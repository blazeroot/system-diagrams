# webclient-system-diagram 
### server side included too!
Visualise your system in real time using this standalone tool.

So far it's ready for rendering **sequence call system diagrams** (using js lib: [bramp/js-sequence-diagrams](https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams)) and **system graphs** (using js lib: [cpettitt/dagre](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre) and [cpettitt/dagre-d3](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre-d3)).

Besides these js resources it's written in clojure and mainly based on [http-kit](http://www.http-kit.org/),  [stuartsierra/component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) and [juxt/modular](https://github.com/juxt/modular)

# Simple Usage

## Get the project (using git or lein-try)

Using git 

```
$ git clone git@github.com:tangrammer/webclient-system-diagram.git
$ cd webclient-system-diagram
$ lein repl

```

Using [lein-try](https://github.com/rkneufeld/lein-try)
```
$ lein try tangrammer/webclient-system-diagram "0.1.5"

```

### Start server side 

By default dashboard will use 8011 and 8012 ports (you can change the configuration in [.dashboard.edn](https://github.com/tangrammer/sequence-diagram-dashboard/blob/master/resources/.dashboard.edn))

Start the dashboard and open the web client

```clojure
user=> (dev)
dev=> (go)

```

### Open web clients (browser tabs) 

http://localhost:8011/sequence   
http://localhost:8011/graph

## visualising sequences
You need to send your data sequence to this entrypoint ```http://localhost:8011/publish-sequence``` following [bramp/js-sequence-diagrams](https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams) data format.

Example using curl:
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"sequence":"Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you? \n Note right of Bob: Bob thinks \n Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!"}' http://localhost:8011/publish-sequence
```

## visualising graphs
You need to send your data graph to this entrypoint ```http://localhost:8011/publish-graph``` following [cpettitt/dagre-d3](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre-d3) data format.

Example using curl:
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"graph":"digraph {A -> B -> C; B -> D; D -> E;}"}' http://localhost:8011/publish-graph
```
