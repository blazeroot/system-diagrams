# webclient-system-diagram 
###(server side included too!)
Visualise your system in real time using this standalone tool.

So far it's ready for rendering **sequence call system diagrams** (using js lib: [bramp/js-sequence-diagrams](https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams)) and **system graphs** (using js lib: [cpettitt/dagre](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre) and [cpettitt/dagre-d3](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre-d3)).

Besides these js resources it's written in clojure and mainly based on [http-kit](http://www.http-kit.org/),  [stuartsierra/component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) and [juxt/modular](https://github.com/juxt/modular)

# Simple Usage

### Start server side and open clients

By default dashboard will use 8011 and 8012 ports (you can change the configuration in [.dashboard.edn](https://github.com/tangrammer/sequence-diagram-dashboard/blob/master/resources/.dashboard.edn))

Start the dashboard and open the web client

```clojure
$ cd milesian-sequence-diagram
$ lein repl
$ (dev)
$ (go)
$ (clojure.java.browse/browse-url "http://localhost:8011/sequence")
$ (clojure.java.browse/browse-url "http://localhost:8011/graph")

```

## visualising sequences
You need to send your sequence to this entrypoint ```http://localhost:8011/publish-sequence``` following [bramp/js-sequence-diagrams](https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams) data format.

Example using curl:
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"sequence":"Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you? \n Note right of Bob: Bob thinks \n Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!"}' http://localhost:8011/publish-sequence
```

## visualising graphs
You need to send your sequence to this entrypoint ```http://localhost:8011/publish-graph``` following [cpettitt/dagre-d3](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre-d3) data format.

Example using curl:
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"graph":"digraph {A -> B -> C; B -> D; D -> E; ;}"}' http://localhost:8011/publish-graph
```
