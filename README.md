# milesian/sequence-diagram-dashboard

This is a tool for displaying HTML sequence diagrams.

Using milesian/aop we can log the component call sequence, so it's very easy to render as sequence diagrams.

This project uses [bramp/js-sequence-diagrams](https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams) for js/HTML SVG rendering
