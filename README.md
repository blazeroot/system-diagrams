# sequence-diagram-dashboard

This is a clojure tool for displaying HTML sequence diagrams. It's based on webapp and websocket. It uses [stuartsierra/component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) and [juxt/modular](https://github.com/juxt/modular)

This project uses [bramp/js-sequence-diagrams](https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams) for js/HTML SVG rendering

## Simple Usage following REPL

By default dashboard will use 8011 and 8012 ports (you can change the configuration in [.dashboard.edn](https://github.com/tangrammer/sequence-diagram-dashboard/blob/master/resources/.dashboard.edn))

Start the dashboard and open the web client

```clojure
$ cd milesian-sequence-diagram
$ lein repl
$ (dev)
$ (go)
$ (clojure.java.browse/browse-url "http://localhost:8011/dashboard")

```

From anywhere (any app you need to visualize) make post calls to sending sequence value to visualize

``` 

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"sequence":"Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you? \n Note right of Bob: Bob thinks \n Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!"}' http://localhost:8011/publish
```
