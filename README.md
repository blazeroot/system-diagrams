# milesian/system-diagrams
This project is intended to get real time system visualisations, thus include:

 +  a standalone tool to visualise your system in real time. Thus it includes a couple of server entrypoints (to recieve the data to represent), a websocket and a couple of html pages to render data using js. 
 +  a system graph formatter fns utilities

So far it's ready for rendering **sequence call system diagrams** (using js lib: [bramp/js-sequence-diagrams](https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams)) and **system graphs** (using js lib: [cpettitt/dagre](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre) and [cpettitt/dagre-d3](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre-d3)).

Besides these js resources it's written in clojure and mainly based on [http-kit](http://www.http-kit.org/),  [stuartsierra/component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component), [juxt/modular](https://github.com/juxt/modular) and [milesian/aop](https://github.com/milesian/aop)

#### Releases and Dependency Information


```clojure
[milesian/system-diagrams "0.1.2"]
```

```clojure 
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.6.0"]
                 [com.stuartsierra/component "0.2.2"]
                 [juxt.modular/http-kit "0.5.3"]
                 [juxt.modular/bidi "0.6.1"]
                 [juxt.modular/clostache "0.6.0"]

```


# Instructions to use it as a standalone tool

#### Get the project 

```
$ git clone git@github.com:milesian/system-diagrams.git
$ cd system-diagrams
```

#### Start server side 

By default dashboard will use 8011 and 8012 ports (you can change the configuration in [dashboard.edn](https://github.com/milesian/system-diagrams/blob/master/resources/.dashboard.edn))

Start the dashboard and open the web client

`$ lein run`

#### Open web clients (browser tabs) 

[http://localhost:8011/sequence](http://localhost:8011/sequence)   
[http://localhost:8011/graph](http://localhost:8011/graph)

#### Sending system sequences data

Open your [web client](http://localhost:8011/sequence)   

You need to send your data sequence to this entrypoint ```http://localhost:8011/publish-sequence``` following [bramp/js-sequence-diagrams](https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams) data format.

Example using curl:
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"sequence":"Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you? \n Note right of Bob: Bob thinks \n Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!"}' http://localhost:8011/publish-sequence
```


#### Sending system graphs data
Open your [web client](http://localhost:8011/graph)   

You need to send your data graph to this entrypoint ```http://localhost:8011/publish-graph``` following [cpettitt/dagre-d3](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre-d3) data format.

Example using curl:
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"graph":"digraph {A -> B -> C; B -> D; D -> E;}"}' http://localhost:8011/publish-graph
```


# Instructions to use it in your stuartsierra/component system to visualise your system calls

**Update your project deps**

```clojure
;; Update your dev dependencies 
:profiles {:dev {:dependencies [ ...
                                  [milesian/system-diagrams "0.1.2"]
                                  [milesian/bigbang "0.1.1"]
                                  [milesian/aop "0.1.4"]
                                  [milesian/identity "0.1.3"]

   [milesian.aop :as aop]
   [milesian.aop.utils  :refer (extract-data)]
   [milesian.sequence-diagram :refer (store-message try-to-publish store)]
   [milesian.system-diagrams.webclient.system :as wsd]

		 ...))

(defn diagram
  "to get sequence diagram we need the ->start-fn-call and
  the <-return-fn-call times of the fn invocation call.
  The sequence will be published if all fns are finished (:closed)"
  [*fn* this & args]

  "Starts the current development system."
  []
  (alter-var-root #'system #(bigbang/expand % {:before-start [[identity/add-meta-key %]
